About me
- Hello World !
-  Iâ€™m George Dumitrascu
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on QA Software Testing opportunities.
- Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Manual Testing through the "Testare manuala si automata (Curs QA)"  course recorded by Mr. Radu Popescu . You can find the course link here:
     https://www.udemy.com/course/testare-manuala-si-automata-curs-qa/

As a passionate and ambitious individual, I am constantly seeking ways to improve myself and acquire new knowledge with patience and optimism. 

I also attend webinars on Manual and Automation Testing, where I am trying my best to gain a better understanding of new concepts and ideas. 

On My GitHub portfolio i will try to reflect my continued efforts to stay updated with the latest developments in the field.

Additionally, I have started experimenting with various challenges on the platform Frontend Mentor . Here is my profile : https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/georgebuc1
